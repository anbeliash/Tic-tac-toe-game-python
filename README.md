# Tic-tac-toe-game-python

## Description
The game consists of a board. The number of columns and columns must be entered at the start of the game. All squares take the state: circle. As part of the game, the player is asked to choose a row and column number. After selecting, the state of a given field and four adjacent fields is changed to the opposite one (instead of a circle we put a cross, instead of a cross we put a circle). The program selects a random number of unused fields and the number is displayed on the screen. There is also a time limit and after each step you see how much you have left.
